# finntrack
This app allows the user to stay on track with their expenses. It is a "virtual wallet" where you can see how much you spent in what category and in different currencies.

## About the project: 
Making a useful and beautifully designed application was the aim of this project. After logging in, the user is presented with a table where they may record their expenses, categorise them using different tags, provide a description of their spending, and even select the currency they spent. It comes in very handy when converting from BRL.

## Technologies used:
> React.js, JavaScript, CSS, Redux, RTL (react testing library), Chart.js.

# The final result:
